# Position-Based Dynamics Pinball Simulator

This is a web-based (HTML + JavaScript) pinball physics simulator that uses vector calculations and collision detection to model the motion of a ball in a pinball machine environment.

## Project Overview

This pinball simulator implements a physics engine to simulate the movement of a ball under gravity, its collisions with obstacles, and scoring mechanics. The ball is released from a launch channel, travels through a semi-circular orbital area and rectangular playfield, interacts with multiple obstacles, and finally lands in different scoring zones.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**: Core development technologies
- **Canvas API**: For rendering game elements and animations
- **requestAnimationFrame**: Efficient frame updates for smooth animations
- **Vector Calculations**: For handling collision detection and response

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Simulates realistic pinball physics and gameplay
- ðŸ§± Multiple layers of obstacles for challenging gameplay
- ðŸŽ¯ Different scoring zones with varied point values
- âš¡ Accurate collision detection and response
- ðŸŽ¨ Smooth visual effects and animations
- ðŸ“Š Real-time score calculation and display

## Game Elements

- Ball: The main interactive object
- Orbital area: Semi-circular upper region
- Obstacles: Multiple circular objects arranged throughout the game
- Launch channel: Controls the release of the ball
- Scoring zones: Different colored scoring areas at the bottom

## How to Play

Simply open the Pinball.html file in a web browser to start the game. The ball will automatically launch with a random initial velocity, simulating physical motion within the game environment and calculating scores.
